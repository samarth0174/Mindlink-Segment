  <li>1Ô∏è‚É£ Decrease Member Usage after First Free Trial
        Impact: Reduced utilization may translate to lower conversion rates to paid subscriptions.
</li>
  <li>2Ô∏è‚É£ Ineffectiveness of Current Promotional Offers
        Insight: Reevaluate the value proposition of promotions to align with user expectations and needs.</li>
  <li>3Ô∏è‚É£ Limited Post-Trial Communication
        Strategy: Strengthen post-trial communication to highlight continued value and encourage 
        subscription renewals.</li>

<ol>
<li>
<h3>Utilization of Data for Personalization</h3>
<p>MindLink seamlessly leverages Twilio Segment to collect data across various touchpoints, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teleconsultations:</strong> Session duration, topics discussed, doctor-patient rapport.</li>
<li><strong>In-app journeys:</strong> Feature usage, content engagement, app navigation patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Promotional campaigns:</strong> Click-through rates, discount coupon usage, campaign responses.</li>
<li><strong>Eventbrite course sign-ups:</strong> Interest areas, learning preferences, event attendance.</li>
</ul>
<p>While invisible to users like Jane, this data is the foundation of her personalized MindLink experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Modern Data Foundation with Segment and Data Lakehouse</h3>
![Solution](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ePijsCu8luyPlaqt5lDGF33JyFnIDiRm)
<p>MindLink built a modern data foundation with powerful connections from Twilio Segment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Data flows seamlessly into the lakehouse, a central repository for all user information.</li>
<li>This unified view empowers advanced analytics and personalizations, unlike siloed data systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Composable Customer Data Platform</h3>
![CDP](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1eTnbSDTypS0TSMck4NznUSz0do7587gO)

<p>MindLink leverages Databricks and AWS to build a robust data management platform.</p>
<ul>
<li>This "composable" approach allows for flexible integration of various data sources and tools.</li>
<li>It enables advanced use cases like:</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-touch attribution:</strong> Understand the impact of different marketing channels on user behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Customer segmentation:</strong> Group users with similar needs and preferences for targeted interventions.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Relevant datasets used (mock, historical, and event data) include:</p>
 <ul>
    <li>campaign_desc (Mock)</li>
    <li>campaign_table (Mock)</li>
    <li>causal_data (via Twilio Segment)</li>
    <li>coupon (Mock)</li>
    <li>coupon_redempt (via Twilio Segment)</li>
    <li>user_demographic (Mock)</li>
    <li>product (Mock)</li>
    <li>transaction_data (Mock)</li>
    <li>events_stream (via Twilio Segment)</li>
</ul>
<p>Raw data resides on Amazon S3 (bronze layer), undergoes transformations (silver layer), and finally, clustering creates golden profile views (gold layer).</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Advanced Personalization Using Clustering Algorithms</h3>
<p>Aggregated information from Twilio Segment is analyzed using clustering algorithms, like the AutoML feature in Databricks, to create distinct customer profiles.</p>
<ul>
<li>This goes beyond basic demographics, uncovering hidden patterns in user activity, sales, and campaign data.</li>
<li>These insights form the basis for personalized promotions and user journeys.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Creation of Customer Personas for Targeted Marketing</h3>
<p>By analyzing user data, MindLink understands household behavior and builds comprehensive customer personas.</p>
<ul>
<li>These personas inform personalized promotions, content recommendations, and app features across various touchpoints.</li>
<li>For example, a new user might receive a welcome email with resources specific to their identified persona.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Syncing Customer Personas with Upstream Destinations</h3>
<p>Twilio Segment's Revere ETL seamlessly syncs generated customer personas.</p>
<ul>
<li>The lakehouse acts as the source, and various destinations, like email marketing tools, receive updated profiles.</li>
<li>MindLink uses Salesforce Marketing Cloud to send personalized emails based on individual user personas.</li>
<li>Golden profiles are also synced with the Practice Management System, enhancing the consultation experience for both users and practitioners.</li>
<li>This continuous feedback loop allows for ongoing refinement of user segmentation, personalization, and overall user experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>

## Challenges we ran into
![Data Silos](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14euczhtZxltUzy-DwFq1YrD0cxSrz1qP)

During the development process, one of the major challenges was breaking the data silos and secondly Identity resolution when marrying multiple data sources. 

## What we learned

The journey of building Mindlink Care taught us valuable lessons about adaptability and resilience in the face of technological challenges. We gained a deeper understanding of the importance of choosing the right technologies for real-time data analysis and the significance of continuous learning in the rapidly evolving field of AI and machine learning.

## What's next for MindLink  (GenAI usecase):

We aspire to leverage more data sources and GenAI to create a personalized, data-driven user engagement strategy. No more generic push notifications, just nudges that feel like they were crafted just for the user.

    <h3>Data Orchestration: The Maestro of Mental Wellness</h3>
    <p>Databricks acts as the conductor, harmonizing diverse data sources into a symphony of insights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>App Usage:</strong> Feature engagement, session duration, frequency, and navigation patterns.</li>
      <li><strong>Self-Reported Data:</strong> Mood surveys, journaling entries, and symptom trackers.</li>
      <li><strong>Biometric Data (optional, with user consent):</strong> Sleep patterns and heart rate variability.</li>
      <li><strong>External Data:</strong> Weather and anonymized social media activity (privacy-preserving).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Gen-AI Feature Engineering: Beyond the Obvious</h3>
    <p>Instead of meticulously crafting features, Gen-AI models automatically extract hidden patterns and insights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Temporal Relationships:</strong> Uncover patterns in data sequences, like increased app usage before anxiety spikes.</li>
      <li><strong>Nuanced Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Go beyond basic sentiment to understand emotional context and triggers.</li>
      <li><strong>Personalized User Profiles:</strong> Capture individual patterns and responses to interventions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Targeted Interventions: Tailored Support Every Step of the Way</h3>
    <p>Leveraging Twilio Segment, we deliver targeted interventions through various channels:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Push notifications with timely reminders and motivational messages.</li>
      <li>In-app messages offering personalized exercises and coping mechanisms.</li>
      <li>SMS nudges for self-care activities and check-ins.</li>
    </p>
    <p>We meticulously track user engagement and gather feedback through surveys and chat logs, ensuring continuous improvement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Real-time Data Ingestion for Immediate Insights</h3>
    <p>We're harnessing the power of Kafka pub-sub and Delta Live Tables for near real-time data ingestion and processing of our clickstream feeds. This allows us to react to emerging trends and personalize interventions with minimal delay, maximizing their impact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Fresh Propensity Scoring: Always One Step Ahead</h3>
    <p>Every week, we utilize Databricks AutoML scheduler to automatically retrain our propensity scoring model with fresh data. This ensures our predictions and interventions remain relevant and effective in the ever-changing landscape of our user base.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Gen-AI for Hyper-Personalization and A/B Testing</h3>
    <p>We're taking personalization to the next level with Gen-AI, crafting dynamic campaigns and A/B testing variations that resonate with individual users.This data-driven approach ensures we deliver the most relevant support at the right time, optimizing user engagement and outcomes.</p>
